    "In Part 3 of our HHS adventures, we return to our state-level data on labor supply by prime-aged women aged 25-54. Our analytical objective in this section is to use the cool geographic mapping procedures in R to examine changes in the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate from 2015 to 2022. As is the consistent theme, the general goal here is to see whether pre-COVID trends are back.  Because if they're not, HHS leadership could advocate for policies to support segments of women in the labor force, for example, women with small children.\n",
